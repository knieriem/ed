ed (pronounced as distinct letters, /ˌiːˈdiː/) is a line editor for
Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It was one of the first parts
of the Unix operating system that was developed, in August 1969.
It remains part of the POSIX and Open Group standards for Unix-based
operating systems, alongside the more sophisticated full-screen
editor vi.

The ed text editor was one of the first three key elements of the
Unix operating system—assembler, editor, and shell—developed by Ken
Thompson in August 1969 on a PDP-7 at AT&T Bell Labs. Many features
of ed came from the qed text editor developed at Thompson's alma
mater University of California, Berkeley. Thompson was very familiar
with qed, and had reimplemented it on the CTSS and Multics systems.
Thompson's versions of qed were notable as the first to implement
regular expressions. Regular expressions are also implemented in
ed, though their implementation is considerably less general than
that in qed.

Dennis M. Ritchie produced what Doug McIlroy later described as the
"definitive" ed, and aspects of ed went on to influence ex, which
in turn spawned vi. The non-interactive Unix command grep was
inspired by a common special use of qed and later ed, where the
command g/re/p performs a global regular expression search and
prints the lines containing matches. The Unix stream editor, sed
implemented many of the scripting features of qed that were not
supported by ed on Unix.
